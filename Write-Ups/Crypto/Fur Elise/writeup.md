In the question we have been given an Image of Musical notes. On searching we get to know it is Acéré Cipher. Also hint given in this question states that it is Acéré Cipher.

Decoding image with Acéré Cipher give a random string.

Taking the first one as its default.
Decoded String becomes 
669B21F55F166521E05CB04375D0AEA3C2FB87379E109C03C3038908E81BA505C67747CE1884CD1A036D5E0BFE8DCF3B
Now as Stated in Question Description, there was SEA of images.
In this SEA is highlighted, cracking it we can get to know it’s something related to AES also there’s a string given in question, i.e., moonlightsonataa.
It is visible that length of this string is 16 which makes sense for and AES Decryption.
Hence doing Decryption using AES we can get Flag.

Flag: INSEC{b33th0v3_1s_th3_gr34t3st_c0mp0s3r}
